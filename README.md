The most powerful, high performing and highly polished Z-Wave node for Node-RED based on Z-Wave JS. If you want a fully featured Z-Wave framework in your Node-RED instance, you have found it.

> ### ...node-red-contrib-zwave-js is _hands down the best Z-Wave to Node-RED option on the planet._
> [@CRXPorter](https://github.com/crxporter), July 2021.

## What is it?

 - Part of the awesome [Z-Wave JS](https://github.com/zwave-js) org
 - 100% Javascript, so its blazing fast!
 - Does not require a build of any static library
 - Stable
 - A deep integrated UI within in node red
 - Full Z-Wave control inside Node-RED including:
   - Multi Stick/Network support
   - Device inclusion/exclusion wizard
   - S0 and S2 security support
   - Supports Security S2 Smart Start via a Mobile (and local) companion web application.
   - Network health checks
   - Network mesh graph
   - Device Firmware updates
   - Advanced RF configuration
   - NVM Backup/Restore
   - Associations management
   - Filter node for handling incoming messages from your devices
   - Factory node for simplifying the formatting of outgoing messages
   - Multicast command support
   - And much more..


Since `node-red-contrib-zwave-js` is based on [Z-Wave JS](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/), we have the support and active maintenance from the amazing group of developers who have built the libraries, APIs, and config files which run this contrib.

## The User Interface

![Image](./GHImages/ZWUI.gif)

Included with the contrib is a [user interface](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-red-contrib-zwave-js/wiki/User-Interface) where Z-Wave network management is handled. The controller side of the UI is used to include/exclude devices, heal the network, update firmware, and view the network map for diagnosing problems. The device side of the UI is used to configure devices, manage associations, and provide setup help for the nodes which will be used in your flows.

## The Nodes

![Image](./GHImages/Demo.png)

There are 4 node types included with this contrib ([click here](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-red-contrib-zwave-js/wiki/node-types) for full details about these nodes)
 - `ZWave Controller`: this node is used to set up a connection to your USB Z-Wave controller, set security keys, and manage various advanced controller options
 - `ZWave Device`: this node is used to send and receive messages to one or more of the Z-Wave devices on your network
 - `Event Filter`: this node is used to filter and sort messages from your Z-Wave devices
 - `CMD Factory`: this node simplifies creation of messages being sent to your Z-Wave devices

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to customize the behavior of node-red-contrib-zwave-js:

- `ZWAVE_JS_PROTOCOL`: Override the protocol (http/https) used in URLs generated by the web interface. This is particularly useful when running nodeRED in a docker container that is behind a reverse proxy that handles HTTPS termination. By default, HTTPS is used when secure mode is enabled and HTTP when it's disabled. Examples:
  - If your reverse proxy (like Caddy) handles HTTPS and forwards to Node-RED over HTTP, set this to `https` to ensure the browser generates secure URLs while still allowing Node-RED to run with HTTP internally.
  - Default behavior without this variable: Uses `https://` when requests are https, and `http://` when requests are http.
