Since `node-red-contrib-zwave-js` is based on [Z-Wave JS](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/), we have the support and active maintenance from the amazing group of developers who have built the libraries, APIs, and config files which run this contrib.

### The User Interface

![Image](./GHImages/ZWUI.gif) 

Included with the contrib is a [user interface](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-red-contrib-zwave-js/wiki/User-Interface) where Z-Wave network management is handled. The controller side of the UI is used to include/exclude devices, heal the network, update firmware, and view the network map for diagnosing problems. The device side of the UI is used to configure devices, manage associations, and provide setup help for the nodes which will be used in your flows.

### The Nodes
